# Proxmox App
A simple chromium-based Proxmox application created with the aim to make accessing your server more easier.

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/N4GR/proxmox-app/blob/main/assets/readme/secondary.png?raw=true" alt="Secondary-Banner"></div>

# Install
Trying to make things as easy as possible for users that aren't tech-savvy, there's a built in installer provided with each [release](https://github.com/N4GR/proxmox-app/releases/latest).

# Usage
The application requires admin priveleges; don't be alarmed, this is just so it's able to create the necessary history files in its directory; you should be able to just launch the application and everything works out-the-box.
